    A design pattern provides a conceptual solution to commonly occuring software engineering problems whereas a library provides code for common software engineering functionalities. A design pattern is much more conceptual that can't be captured in common libraries.


2.

    public static databaseConnection getInstance {

        if there is no connection{

            create connection

        }

      otherwise return use existing connection

    }


3.

public class AnimalFactory {

    change type in case where
         animal is Bird
            return Bird type
         animal is Mammal
            return Mammal type

}

4.

public class MammalAdapter extends Aquarioum{
    
    private Mammal mammal;

    public MammalAdapter(Mammal mam){
        mammal = mam;
    }

    public void feedAll(String food, int weight, String medication){
            return mam.feed(food, weight, medication)
    }

    public void cleanAll(){
        return mam.clean();
    }

}

    Bridge design patterns lead to less overall confusion when dealing with a lot of classes that extend a paraent class. With it's reaggregation mechanisms, we can limit the amount of classes needed to be written while maintaining the necessary functionalities
